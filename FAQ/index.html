                <p id="text1">Video calling lets you call your contacts using WhatsApp Desktop for free, even if they’re in another country. Video calling uses your internet connection. Desktop calling is supported on Windows 10 64-bit version 1903 and newer and macOS 10.13 and newer. Group calls aren’t supported on WhatsApp Desktop at this time. <button id="close1"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i></button></p>

                <p id="text3">If you received an in-app message saying your account is “Temporarily banned”, this means that you're likely using an unofficial version of WhatsApp, or that you might be harvesting information, which is known as scraping. If you don't switch to the official app or stop engaging in scraping after being temporarily banned, your account might be permanently banned from using WhatsApp. <button id="close3"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i></p>
